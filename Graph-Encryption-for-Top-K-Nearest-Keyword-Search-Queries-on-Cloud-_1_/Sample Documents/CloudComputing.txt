Cloud computing is an information technology IT paradigm, a model for enabling ubiquitous access to shared pools of configurable resources such as Cloud Computing and computer networks, servers, storage, applications and services),[1][2] which can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort, often over the Internet. Cloud computing allows users and enterprises with various computing capabilities to store and process data either in a privately-owned cloud, or on a third-party server located in a data center, thus making data-accessing mechanisms more efficient and reliable.[3][need quotation to verify] Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economy of scale, similar to a utility.
